# Snake Game

## Overview
This project is a console-based Snake game developed in Python using the Pygame library.

## Game Details
- **Description:** The classic Snake game where the player maneuvers a line, called the "snake", which grows in length, with the snake itself being a primary obstacle.
- **Objective:** Control the snake to collect food appearing randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake runs into the screen border or into itself.

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python and Pygame are installed on your machine.
   - Install Pygame using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install pygame
     ```
2. Run the game using the command line:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys:** Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the movement of the snake.
- **Pause:** Press `P` to pause the game.
- **Restart/Close:** Follow the on-screen instructions to restart or quit when the game is over.

## Project Setup
- **Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python installed along with the Pygame library.
- **Run Environment:** This game runs in a terminal and will display a graphical window for the game.
